            Use simple easy to read fonts.
            Use bullet points.
            Only include key information on each slide.
            Be direct and use concise wording.

            <p>This project was created using html knowledge.In order to be able to create this quizz <br>
                you had to use ul and ol and nested lists.The project consisted the work of creating 3 HTML pages which
                contained <br>
                questions and answers. When a user visited the page page_1.html they were presented with the Questions
                section <br>
                If the user clicks the Answer link, the page will scroll down to the specific answer. So, if a user <br>
                clicks the answer link in question number 8, the page will scroll down to answer number 8. <br>
                If a user clicks Back to question, the page will scroll back up to the correct question</p>
